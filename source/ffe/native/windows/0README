              System-Dependent "Native" FFE Components for Windows
              ####################################################

       This directory contains native components for Windows, including:

       (1)  ffe.dll, to let Force Field Explorer launch native executables,
            built from nativeExec.c via the dll.bat script; two versions
            are provided, built with Intel and GNU compilers, both of
            which work correctly

       (2)  jni_md.h, the system-dependent Java Native Interface (JNI)
            header file, should be taken from the Java version whose
            JRE is bundled with FFE, currently Java 1.8.0_251

       (3)  jvm.dll, the main Java virtual machine dynamic library from
            the current bundled version, Java 1.8.0_251; this library
            will must be present in the Tinker executables directory
