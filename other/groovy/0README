                      Groovy for Use in Building Tinker-FFE                   
                      #####################################

        This directory contains Groovy-2.4.4 as downloaded from the site
        www.groovy-lang.org/download.html during August 2015. Groovy is
        used by the FFE shell, which must be built as .class files prior
        to the main FFE build.

        To set up Groovy, first untar the distribution, then follow the 
        steps in install-groovy.pdf by defining GROOVY_HOME and adding
        the $GROOVY_HOME/bin directory to your path. The groovyc compiler
        should then be available at the command line.

        In order to build the FFE shell, run the commands in the script
        at ffe/src/main/groovy/make.console after setting up the Groovy
        compiler.

        The /embeddable/groovy-all-2.4.4.jar file in the distribution is
        a maven version of Groovy to go in the ffe/lib area of the FFE
        source distribution. Make sure the file ffe/build.xml file points
        to the correct groovy version.

        Note Groovy 2.4.7 was tested during December 2016. The FFE shell
        compiles under 2.4.7, but gives an error when run. Code changes
        would likely be needed to use this newer Groovy version.
