                    sunjce_provider for 2048-bit DH Keypairs
                    ########################################

         This directory contains a JAR file, sunjce_provider.jar taken
         from the Java 1.8.0_112 JDK/JRE. It is useable with and able to
         generate 2048-bit DH keypairs, as needed to access modern sites
         under https:// protocols. For example, the NCI Cactus Database
         site used by FFE requires 2048-bit keypairs as of spring 2016.

         This JAR file should be placed in the ffe/lib directory of the
         FFE distribution, and its presence should be noted in the file
         build.xml in the FFE top level directory.
