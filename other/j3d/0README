                 Java3D and JOGL for Use in Building Tinker-FFE
                 ##############################################

        This directory contains the most recent versions of Java3D, JOGL
        and related packages as obtained in April 2018.

        The Java3D package is found as version 1.7.0-pre1 dated May 2017
        and downloaded from:

        http://jogamp.org/deployment/java3d/1.7.0-pre1/jogamp-java3d.7z

        The corresponding version of JOGAMP is version 2.3.2, containing
        JOGL, JOAL and GLUEGEN, dated October 2015 and downloaded from:

        http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive \
                         /jogamp-all-platforms.7z

        The directory provide here contains jar files for Linux, MacOS
        and Windows extracted from the above download.

        These versions of Java3D, JOGL, JOAL and GLUEGEN work on Linux,
        MacOS and Windows.

        The file macos-install-java3d.pdf contains installation info
        for these packages, and how to configure them under Eclipse.

        The file macos-override-java3d.pdf contains info on overriding
        the old Java3D 1.3 install as system software with MacOS. In
        the current FFE build, the override is performed by bundling
        the Java3d jars with the build and specifying the jars to be
        used in the Install4j build configuration (see ffe/build.xml).

        To building FFE, several jar files from this directory should
        be copied to ffe/lib in the build tree. These include:

        j3dcore-1.7.jar
        j3utils-1.7.jar
        vecmath-1.7.jar
        jogl-all.jar
        jogl-all-noawt-natives-linux-amd64.jar
        jogl-all-noawt-natives-macosx-universal.jar
        jogl-all-noawt-natives-windows-amd64.jar
        joal.jar
        joal-natives-linux-amd64.jar
        joal-natives-macosx-universal.jar
        joal-natives-windows-amd64.jar
        gluegen.jar
        gluegen-rt.jar
        gluegen-rt-android-natives-linux-amd64.jar
