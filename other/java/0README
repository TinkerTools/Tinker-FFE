                Java JDK and JRE for Use in Building Tinker-FFE
                ###############################################

        This directory contains Java JRE kits downloaded from Oracle and
        the install4j web site during November 2016. The JDK kits are to
        be installed prior to building FFE, and are needed to run the ant
        script and install4j.

        The "macosx" and "windows" kits are JREs from the install4j site,
        and are to be bundled with the FFE installation kits. install4j
        does not provide pre-bundled JRE kits for Linux, so the "linux"
        JRE kit found here was created from the original Oracle JRE via
        the "createbundle" program provided with install4j.
