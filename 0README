                     Distribution Directory for Tinker-FFE
                     #####################################

         This directory contains the full source distribution and build
         environment for the Tinker-FFE (Force Field Explorer) package.
         FFE is a Java-based molecular engineering and visualization tool
         that provides a GUI interface to the Tinker programs.

         The /source area has full source code for FFE itself, the FFTW
         Fourier Transform package, the APBS Poisson-Boltzmann solver,
         and Tinker. Compressed .tgz archive files for these packages
         are used directly when building FFE.

         The /other area contains code and libraries for many additional
         pieces needed for FFE, such as bundled Java JREs, Java3D, ant,
         groovy, Mesa and Sun JCE routines.

         The /build directory has a build environment for constructing
         FFE install kits for Linux, MacOS and Windows. Scripts provided
         allowing building of FFE installers via the install4j program.
         See /build/0README for the exact procedure for building full
         Tinker-FFE installer kits.

         The current directory has pieces to build Tinker-FFE, except
         for the following: (1) a C/C++/Fortran compiler suite, the GNU
         compilers are recommended, (2) a locally installed version of
         Java 8, and (3) the install4j Java installer builder. Note
         install4j is a commercial package. The full GUI version is not
         needed, only a command line version of the install4jc compiler
         is required.
