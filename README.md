The Tinker-FFE ("Force Field Explorer") software is a Java-based GUI for molecular design and engineering, originally written by Prof. Michael J. Schnieders, now in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Iowa. In addition of a variety of general molecular modeling and visualization capabilities, Tinker-FFE enables launch and control of Tinker calculations from an easy-to-use graphical interface. The Tinker-FFE package runs on Linux, Macintosh and Windows systems.
